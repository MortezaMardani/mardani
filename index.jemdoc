== About me

I am currently a senior AI researcher at NVIDIA research and a visiting researcher at Stanford. I am aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice of machine learning, with a focus on generative learning. My background is in statistical learning and optimization. Prior to NVIDIA, I was a research staff and postdoc at Stanford, working with [https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/ John Pauly], [https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/david-donoho David Donoho], and [https://profiles.stanford.edu/shreyas-vasanawala Shreyas Vasanawala]. I received my PhD from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, under the supervision of [https://cse.umn.edu/ece/georgios-giannakis Georgios Giannakis]. As part of the program, I was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley, RISE Lab.

== Research

I am interested in fundamental research on generative learning that makes a direct product impact. I am currently focused on diffusion models. In the past, I worked on architecture design for deep learning, understanding inductive biases of neural networks, and solving inverse problems using learning. For my PhD, I contributed to large-scale data science and received the "Young Author Best Paper Award" from IEEE Signal Processing Society in 2017.

== Opportunities

I am looking for motivated PhD interns and research scientists interested in generative learning to join our team. Please drop me an email at [mmardani@nvidia.com].
