## Biography

I am currently a senior AI research staff at NVIDIA research and a visiting researcher at Stanford. I aim at bridging the gap between theory and practice of machine learning, with a focus on generative learning. Morteza's background is in statistical learning and optimization. Prior to NVIDIA, I was a research staff and postdoc at Stanford, working with [John Pauly](https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/), [David Donoho](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/david-donoho), and [Shreyas Vasanawala](https://profiles.stanford.edu/shreyas-vasanawala). I received my PhD from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, under the supervision of [Georgios Giannakis](https://cse.umn.edu/ece/georgios-giannakis). As part of the program, I was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley, RISE Lab.

## Research Description

I am interested in fundamental research on generative learning that has a direct product impact. My current focus is on diffusion models. In the past, I worked on architecture design for deep learning, understanding inductive biases of neural networks, and solving inverse problems using learning. My PhD research contributed to large-scale data science and was recognized with the "Young Author Best Paper Award" from IEEE Signal Processing Society in 2017.

## Opportunities

I am looking for motivated PhD interns and research scientists interested in generative learning to join our team. Please drop me an email at [mmardani@nvidia.com](mailto:mmardani@nvidia.com).
