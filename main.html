Morteza Mardani is currently a senior AI research staff at NVIDIA Research and a visiting researcher at Stanford University. He aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice of machine learning, with a specific focus on generative learning.</p>
<p>Morteza's background is in statistical learning and optimization. Prior to joining NVIDIA, he served as a research staff and postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, working with esteemed researchers such as <a href="John">Pauly</a>(https:<i></i>web.stanford.edu<i>&nbsp;pauly</i>), <a href="David">Donoho</a>(https:<i></i>statistics.stanford.edu<i>people</i>david-donoho), and <a href="Shreyas">Vasanawala</a>(https:<i></i>profiles.stanford.edu<i>shreyas-vasanawala). He received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities under the supervision of <a href="Georgios">Giannakis</a>(https:</i><i>cse.umn.edu</i>ece/georgios-giannakis). As part of his Ph.D. program, he was also a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley's RISE Lab.</p>
<p>Morteza's research revolves around the general area of generative learning. He is interested in fundamental research on generative learning that has a direct impact on product development. Currently, his research is focused on diffusion models. In the past, he has worked on architecture design for deep learning, understanding the inductive biases of neural networks, and solving inverse problems using deep learning.</p>
<p>During his Ph.D., Morteza made significant contributions to large-scale data science and was awarded the &ldquo;Test of Time Young Author Best Paper Award&rdquo; from IEEE Signal Processing Society in 2017.</p>
