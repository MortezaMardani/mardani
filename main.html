<p>Morteza is currently a senior AI research staff at NVIDIA research and a visiting researcher at Stanford. He aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice of machine learning, with a focus on generative learning. Mortezaâ€™s background is in statistical learning and optimization. Prior to NVIDIA, he was a research staff and postdoc at Stanford working with John Pauly, David Donoho, and Shreyas Vasanawala. He received his PhD from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, under the supervision of <a href="Georgios">Giannakis</a>(https:<i></i>cse.umn.edu<i>ece</i>georgios-giannakis). As a part of the program, he was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley, RISE Lab.</p>
<p>General Area: Generative Learning</p>
<p>I am interested in fundamental research on generative learning that makes a direct product impact. Currently, I am focused on diffusion models. In the past, I worked on architecture design for deep learning, understanding inductive biases of neural networks, and solving inverse problems using learning. For my PhD, I contributed to large-scale data science, which was recognized by receiving the &ldquo;Young Author Best Paper Award&rdquo; from IEEE Signal Processing Society in 2017.</p>
<p>I am looking for motivated PhD interns and research scientists interested in generative learning to join our team. Please drop me an email at mmardani@nvidia.com.</p>
